This is Poojan Shah’s home on the web!
I am a control engineer at [Jaguar Land Rover](https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/) working on developing actuation system control for Active Suspensions.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur where my academic and research interests scaled to feilds of control, robotics and advanced manufacturing technologies.

In May 2020, I successfully defended my bachelor’s thesis, conducting research under [Prof. Sankha Deb](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~sankhadeb/) at the Computer Integrated Manufacturing Laboratory, IIT Kharagpur. My undergraduate work experiences include leading the mechanical team at the [Autonomous Ground Vehicle](http://www.agv.iitkgp.ac.in/) Research Group advised by Prof. Debashish Chakravarty and pursuing summer internship at [Intelligent Automation Center](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/intelligent-automation/), Loughborough University where I worked on development of soft actuators.
