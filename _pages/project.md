**pipe inspection robot :**
This is my Bachelor Term Project (Undergraduate Thesis) under guidance of Dr. Sankha Deb at department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. The project aimed to develop a modular robotic pipe-inspection system to adapt to different pipe diameters that exist in chemical and power plants. I proposed a 5 degrees of freedom robotic arm manipulator with force-close grippers on both ends, capable of climbing through different pipe diameters externally. Furthermore, I worked on trajectory planning for climbing utilizing robot kinematics and optimization algorithms and tested it in a simulation environment.
