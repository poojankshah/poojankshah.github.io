**1) Pipe Inspection Robot :**
---
This is my Bachelor Term Project (Undergraduate Thesis) under guidance of Dr. Sankha Deb at department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. The project aimed to develop a modular robotic pipe-inspection system to adapt to different pipe diameters that exist in chemical and power plants. I proposed a 5 degrees of freedom robotic arm manipulator with force-close grippers on both ends, capable of climbing through different pipe diameters externally. Furthermore, I worked on trajectory planning for climbing utilizing robot kinematics and optimization algorithms and tested it in a simulation environment.

**2) Autonomous Ground Vehicle Research Group :**
---
Team Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) is a multi-disciplinary research group at IIT Kharagpur aimed at building a fully operational self-driving car. Till my sophomore years, I have worked on building three wheel medium sized mobile robot for the [Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC)](http://www.igvc.org/), Michigan, USA. I majorly worked on CAD with Solidworks and Vibrational and Structural analysis for sensor mounts with ANSYS. 
I have also contributed in implementing and testing PID controllers for mobile robots.

During my junior and senior year, I explored topics of vehicle dynamics and controls. I assisted my colleagues in developing path-tracking controllers for the full-scale electric vehicle Mahindra e2o. I have implemented and tested path tracking control algorithms such as Adaptive PID, LQR, MPC and Pure-Pursuit in a simulation environment as well as on vehicle. 

**3) Rehabilitation Robotics Project : **
---

This project aimed towards designing and developing robotic exoskeleton under guidance of[ Prof. D.K.Pratihar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=gW4Q_7UAAAAJ&hl=en). I worked towards structural optimisation of robotic exoskeleton using genetic algorithms. I performed rigid body analysis and transient structural analysis using ANSYS for 1 cycle of motion to evalaute the stresses. I performed design parameters optimisation by using NSGA-2 for weight reduction.
