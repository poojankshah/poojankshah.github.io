**1) Pipe Inspection Robot :**
---
This is my Bachelor Term Project (Undergraduate Thesis) under guidance of Dr. Sankha Deb at department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. The project aimed to develop a modular robotic pipe-inspection system to adapt to different pipe diameters that exist in chemical and power plants. I proposed a 5 degrees of freedom robotic arm manipulator with force-close grippers on both ends, capable of climbing through different pipe diameters externally. Furthermore, I worked on trajectory planning for climbing utilizing robot kinematics and optimization algorithms and tested it in a simulation environment.

**2) Autonomous Ground Vehicle Research Group :**
---
Team Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) is a multi-disciplinary research group aimed at building a fully operational self-driving car. Till my sophomore years, I have worked on building three wheel medium sized mobile robot for the [Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC)](http://www.igvc.org/), Michigan, USA. I majorly worked on design with Solidworks and Vibrational Analysis for sensor mounts with ANSYS. 
I have also contributed in implementing and testing PID controllers for mobile robots.
