 Fruit Plucking is performed using an end effector, and 3-degree of freedom(DOF) arm (made out of the integration of two linear actuators and a rotating platform) consolidated with a 4-wheeled differential drive mobile platform. Effective implementation of the visual processing is executed on the FPGA Fabric of the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 Board, which accelerates Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with improved Latency and Energy Efficiency as compared to a CPU or GPU based implementation.
